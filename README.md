 # Summary
This analysis explores the  sales of supermarket/grocery items in select stores belonging to the international chain Big Mart during 2013.
In this presentation there are exploratory/explanatoryu data visuals and machine learning. 

### Data:
Big Market Sales Prediction: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/#About

### Business problem:

In looking at grocery sales, interested parties want to know what will will increase sales. This project analyzes what factors have the greatest impact on 
grocery outlet sales.

## Methods
- To perform this analysis the data was cleaned and then exploratory and explanatory visuals offer insights
- Machine learning using regression metrics provides another way to understand grocery sales. 
- Deeper Analysis includes SHAP summary and LIME metrics
- Tableau visuals offer another way to visualize the data.

## Results

#### Visual 1: Bar Graph Showing Outlet Year and Sales
![alt text](https://github.com/Elispreng/Project-1-Food-Sales-and-Store-Cultures/blob/main/Spreng%20Outlet%20Year%20and%20Sales.png)

The graph addresses answers the question "What year has the highest item  sales?" The highest item sales were in 2004.

This bar graph answers the question "What  year has the tighest MRP?" The highest MRP was in 2004

## Machine learning and metrics
- Linear Regression Model
- Regression Tree Model
- Bagged Trees Model

### Linear Regression Metrics:

- Model Training R2: 0.6714424977432687
- Model Testing R2: 2.0994337117833997e-05

### Decision Tree Model Train Scores
 - MAE: 0.0 
 - MSE: 0.0
 - RMSE: 0.0 
 - R2: 1.0

### Decision Tree Model Test Scores
 - MAE: 992.5956 
 - MSE: 2103175.480
 - RMSE: 1450.2329
 - R2: 0.2376974

### Bagged Trees Model Train Scores
 -  MAE: 316.5676
 -  MSE: 240010.0091
 -  RMSE: 489.9082
 -  R2: 0.9189006

### Bagged Trees Model Test Scores
 - MAE: 785.6302
 - MSE: 1279423.2806
 - RMSE: 1131.1159
 - R2: 0.536269

## Recommendations:

From these metrics, the bagged tree model is the best model with the lowest error and highest R2. However, there is still some variance in this model. 

## Limitations & Next Steps

This project will include more graphics. Another limitation is the regression metrics still need tuning in the models.
